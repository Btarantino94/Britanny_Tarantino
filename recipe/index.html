            Ingredients (4 SERVINGS):
            <ul>
            <li>2 cups arepa flour (precooked cornmeal)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>Desired fillings (such as shredded cooked chicken or pork, stewed black beans with cheese and lime, corn salad with onion and fresh herbs; for serving)</li>
            <li>Lime wedges (for serving)</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>Ingredient Info:
Arepa flour is precooked corn flour, not to be confused with masa harina. Sometimes sold as masarepa or harina precocida, it can be found in Latin markets and some supermarkets.
</p>
<p>Preparation
Combine arepa flour and salt in a medium bowl. Make a well in the center and add 2½ cups warm water. Using a wooden spoon, gradually incorporate dry ingredients, stirring until no dry lumps remain. Let rest 5 minutes to hydrate.
Knead dough a few times in bowl, then divide into 8 pieces. Roll each piece on work surface into a ball, then gently flatten to about ½” thick.
Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add 4 arepas, cover, and cook until golden brown, 6–8 minutes. Uncover, flip, and cook (keep uncovered) until other side is golden brown, 6–8 minutes. Transfer arepas to a wire rack. Repeat with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil and dough.
Split arepas and stuff with desired fillings; serve with lime wedges for squeezing over.
